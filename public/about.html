  Currently, I work as a Java instructor at 7isas, where I design and deliver engaging and interactive courses on Java programming
  fundamentals and advanced topics. I also collaborate with other instructors and students to provide feedback and support,
  and to create a positive and inclusive learning environment.
  Previously, I worked as a software engineer at Hannibal&Brothers for Multi Activities, where I contributed to the development,
  testing, and maintenance of web and desktop applications using Java, SQL, and HTML. I also applied my skills in requirements analysis,
  systems analysis, and documentation to ensure the quality and functionality of the software products.
